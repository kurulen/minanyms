The .lua file in this repository houses code that is missing from <a href="https://github.com/etternagame/etterna">etternagame/etterna</a> since version 0.71.0, when the Rebirth theme was released.

I'm creating (yet) another fork of the Rebirth theme that adds a bunch of stuff in, and thought it would be fun to throw these in at the title screen.

Feel free to add PRs, they might be accepted.
